Multidimensional Air Quality Analysis of India: From Data to Policy

Project Overview
This project transforms raw environmental data into an actionable policy roadmap for India. By integrating time-series forecasting, causal clustering, and spatial optimization, we developed a framework to identify not only current pollution levels but also the underlying drivers and geographic "blind spots" in the national monitoring network.
